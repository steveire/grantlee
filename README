About Grantlee
--------------

Grantlee is a set of Free Software libraries written using the Qt framework.
Currently two libraries are shipped with Grantlee: Grantlee Templates and Grantlee
TextDocument.

The goal of Grantlee Templates is to make it easier for application developers to
separate the structure of documents from the data they contain, opening the door
for theming.

The syntax is intended to follow the syntax of the Django template system, and
the design of Django is reused in Grantlee. Django is covered by a BSD style license.

Part of the design of both template systems is that application developers can
extend the syntax by implementing their own tags and filters. For details of how
to do that, see the API documentation.

For template authors, different applications using Grantlee will present the same
interface and core syntax for creating new themes. For details of how to write
templates, see the documentation.

The Grantlee distribution contains several components.

* templates contains the code for parsing and interpreting template
    syntax, as well as interfaces for extending the syntax using plugins.
* textdocument contains some classes for creating textual output from QTextDocuments.
* examples contains some small applications demonstrating how Grantlee can be used.
* loadertags contains the library of tags used to perform template
    inclusion, and inheritance.
* defaulttags contains the library of tags made available by default to
    all templates. These tags include for example 'for', 'if', 'ifequal' etc.
* defaultfilters contains the library of filters made available by default
    to all templates. These filters include for example 'upper', 'lower', 'cut' etc.
* scriptabletags contains a plugin library implementation using QtScript to
    implement plugins.
* tests contains the unit tests for Grantlee.
* scripts contains convenience scripts for creating release tarballs, generating
    documentation, creating translation files etc.
