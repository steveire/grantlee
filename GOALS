The following are goals for future released versions of Grantlee:

Version 0.1:
* Built-in syntax of template system in Django version 1.1.
* Equivalent tags and filters as included by default in Django 1.1.
    Some tags such as {% url %} depend on the Django views system and are not
    relevant to Grantlee.
* Django regression tests ported to Qt/Grantlee.
* i18n support.
* API docs including basics of creating templates. 
* Grantlee support in KJots stable.

Version 0.2:
* Package structure and GHNS integration.
* Partial redesign to take advantage of more Qt features (possibly use QScriptEngine more instead of Context and Variable).
* Grantlee support in KMail, KNode, Akregator.

Version 0.3 and later:
* Kopete themes
* Akonadi mail-merge agent
* Grantlee-mime
* Tools and widgets for creating templates.
* Define some new goals
